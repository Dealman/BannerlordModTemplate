## Installation
Simply download the latest release or download the source and build it yourself. Run BannerlordModTemplate.vsix and you'll be prompted to install the extension.

## Uninstalling
Open VS and at the top toolbar you'll have a tab called _"Extensions"_ click there and then choose _"Manage Extensions"_ and you can choose to uninstall it form there.

## What It Does
• Automatically creates a **SubModule Class**. For example, **MyModSubModule.cs**.  
• Automatically creates a **SubModule.xml** file and copies it to your mod folder when you build and it is newer.  
• Automatically sets the **Ouput Directory** for building.  
• Automatically sets the **Working Directory** for debugging.  
• Automatically sets the path to Bannerlord.exe for debugging.  
• Automatically sets the command-line arguments for launching Bannerlord with the native modules as well as yours.  

Basically, you can run your mod directly after you've created the project. Magic D:
